# SQL Projects for Data Analysis using Oracle Database

𝗔𝗜𝗠:  
In this SQL Project for Data Analysis, We will learn to efficiently leverage various analytical features and functions accessible through SQL in Oracle Database.

The project’s Agenda involves Analyzing the data using SQL on the Oracle Database Software. We first download the Oracle Database 21c edition from the Oracle website and understand the problem. Then tables are created in the database followed by data insertion into tables and exploration, i.e., noticing relationships between tables, walking through the columns, and seeing comments. And perform the following activties--  
1. Records are displayed in an ordered manner, handling NULL values, and selecting records based on patterns like Wildcard, Operators, etc. Then working on Data Manipulation commands(DML) for Data Analysis. Then taking Backup of the Table where migration is going on and use COMMIT and ROLLBACK commands.   
2. Understanding different types of Joins(Inner join, Left outer join, Right outer join, Full outer join, Self join), different types of Operators(Minus, Union, Union all, Intersect).  
3. data analysis using Sub-query, Group-by clause and Exists clause. It also consists of using inline view and aggregate functions(Min, Max, Count, Avg) to perform better analysis on data.  
4. data analysis using WITH clause, the difference between COUNT(*) and COUNT(column_name), Categorization using the CASE statement, and various real-life case studies/problem statements.  
5. data analysis using different SQL functions like ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK, SUBSTR, INSTR, COALESCE and NVL. It also involves the use of some built-in functions like concat, upper, lower, initcap, rtrim, ltrim, length, lpad, rpad.  
6. introduction to Data Wrangling, operations on missing data, unwanted features and duplicated records. It also involves the use of the pivot and unpivot in SQL.  
7. understanding of the Online Shopping Database, and using this database to perform the following Data Wrangling activities-  
a. Split full name into the first name and last name.  
b. Correct phone numbers and emails which are not in a proper format and Correct contact number and remove full name.  
c. Read BLOB column and fetch attribute details from the regular tag, nested columns.  
d. Create separate tables for blob attributes.  
e. Remove invalid records from order_items where shipment_id is not mapped.  
f. Map missing first name and last name with email id credentials.

Dataset Analysis is defined as manipulating or processing unstructured data or raw data to draw valuable insights and conclusions that will help derive critical decisions that will add some business value. The dataset analysis process is followed by organizing the dataset, transforming the dataset, visualizing the dataset, and finally modeling the dataset to derive predictions for solving the business problems, making informed decisions, and effectively planning for the future.

𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗣𝗶𝗽𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗲:  
It refers to a system for moving data from one system to another. The data may or may not be transformed, and it may be processed in real-time (or streaming) instead of batches. A data pipeline is extracting or capturing data using various tools, storing raw data, cleaning, validating data, transforming data into a query-worthy format, visualization of KPIs including Orchestration of the above process is data pipeline.
